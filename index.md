## About me

Hey there. Welcome to my site! \
I'm studying music technology at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in Montreal, QC, Canada. \
Exploring a range of interdisciplinary topics in music information retrieval, my research involves signal processing, machine learning, and music. \
I'm a research assistant at [Distributed Digital Music Archives & Libraries Lab](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/), currently working on a Django rebuild of [CantusDB](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/). I'm also a student member at [Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT)](https://www.cirmmt.org/).

In my spare time, I make heavy metal noise with my electric guitar. 

You can get a PDF version of my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/my_CV.pdf).

## Current Projects:

- Key Estimation of Polyphonic Music Signal using Harmonic Pitch Class Profile (HPCP). 

- Interactive Demo of Electric Guitar Synthesis Model based on Extended Karplus-Strong Algorithm. 

- More projects coming soon...
