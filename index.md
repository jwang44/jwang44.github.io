## About me

Hey there. Welcome to my site! \
I'm studying music technology at McGill University in Montreal, QC, Canada. \
Exploring a range of interdisciplinary topics in music information retrieval, my research involves signal processing, machine learning, and music. \
I'm a research assistant at [Distributed Digital Music Archives & Libraries Lab](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/), currently working on a Django rebuild of [CantusDB](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/). 

In my spare time, I make heavy metal noise with my electric guitar. 

You can get a PDF version of my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/my_CV.pdf).

## Current Projects:

- Key Estimation of Polyphonic Music Signal using Harmonic Pitch Class Profile (HPCP). 
- Interactive Demo of Electric Guitar Synthesis Model based on Extended Karplus-Strong Algorithm. 
- More projects coming soon...
