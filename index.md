## About me
Hey there. Welcome to my site! 

I'm studying music technology at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in Montreal, QC, Canada. \
Exploring a range of interdisciplinary topics in music information retrieval, my research involves signal processing, machine learning, and music. \
I'm a research assistant at [Distributed Digital Music Archives & Libraries Lab](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/), currently working on Django web development. I'm also a student member at [Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT)](https://www.cirmmt.org/).

## Current Project:
I'm currently working on detecting expression techniques in guitar audio recordings. Specifically, I'm working with guitar audio signals and annotations generated from Guitar Pro files. With supervised machine learning, I aim to identify instances of *bend*, *vibrato*, *hammer-on*, *pull-off*, and *slide* in guitar solo recordings.
